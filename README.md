OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
The goal of this project is to design and implement a database to efficiently manage student records, including personal details, course enrollments, and grades. The project focuses on practicing relational database concepts, understanding how to organize data into tables, and writing SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and combine data across multiple tables.

By the end of the project, you will have:

Created a well-structured relational database.
Defined and managed student, course, and enrollment data.
Written SQL queries to perform various data operations.
Utilized JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
Key Activities:
Design Database Schema: Define tables for Students, Courses, and Enrollments, each with appropriate relationships (primary keys, foreign keys) and constraints.

Implement SQL Queries:

Create tables and insert sample data.
Write queries to manage student records (insertion, updating, deletion).
Retrieve information using SQL SELECT queries.
Apply Joins: Use JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables, such as viewing students' details along with their enrolled courses and grades.

Data Management and Manipulation: Use SQL to update student records, modify grades, and retrieve records based on specific criteria (e.g., students enrolled in a particular course).

Technologies Used:
SQL (Structured Query Language): For creating and managing the database, executing queries, and performing JOIN operations.
Database Management System (DBMS): MySQL or any relational DBMS (such as PostgreSQL, SQLite) to host and manage the database.
VS Code with SQL Tools Extension: To write and run SQL queries directly in the integrated development environment (IDE).
Steps to Get the Output:
Set Up the Environment:

Install a DBMS (e.g., MySQL).
Set up VS Code with the SQL Tools extension or use a local database management tool like MySQL Workbench.
Create Database and Tables:

Define the tables for Students, Courses, and Enrollments using SQL CREATE TABLE commands. The schema should include relationships such as primary and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.
Conclusion:
This project provides practical experience in designing and managing relational databases. By following the outlined steps, youâ€™ll be able to build a functional system for managing student records, practice SQL queries, and understand how to implement joins to combine data from multiple tables.
